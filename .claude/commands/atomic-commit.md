description: Create an atomic git commit with a focused message
---

Create an atomic commit for the current staged changes. Follow these rules:

## Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <subject>

[optional body]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc (no code change)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance, dependencies, config

### Rules
1. Subject line max 50 characters
2. Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
3. No period at the end of subject
4. Body explains WHAT and WHY, not HOW
5. One logical change per commit

## Process

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --staged` to see what's being committed
2. If nothing is staged, run `git diff` to see unstaged changes and ask user what to stage
3. Analyze the changes and determine the appropriate type and subject
4. Create a focused commit message
5. Run the commit
6. Show `git log -1` to confirm

## Important
- Do NOT add any AI attribution, co-author tags, or "generated by" notices
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change
- If changes span multiple concerns, suggest splitting into multiple commits
