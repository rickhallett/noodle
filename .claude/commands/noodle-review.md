description: Review entries pending manual classification
---

Use the noodle_pending MCP tool to get entries needing manual review.

For each entry:
1. Show the entry ID, current type, and title
2. Suggest what the correct type might be based on the content
3. Ask if the user wants to retype any entries

If the user wants to retype, use the noodle_retype tool.
